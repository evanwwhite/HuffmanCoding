QUESTIONS:
1. What kinds of files lead to lots of compression? 
Files with words and letters lead to more compression because the Huffman tree can be able to detect
and specify more patters.
2. What kinds of files saw little to no compression?
Files that led to less to no compression is image files or video files.
3. The benchmarking program skips files with .hf suffixes (as in, it does not compress
already compressed files). Edit the code to remove this restriction. What happens when
you try to compress a .hf file that has already been compressed?
I think there are more files to compressed and the second compressor will also add another header
to the already compressed and also create a new huffman tree which makes it a lot more ineffecient.
